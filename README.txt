Description
======================================================================

A collection of tools, mostly [Bash][bash] scripts, for dealing with
thing as I encounter them. Each may have its own requirements and
instructions, for which see the source of each.

-   `dir-merger` Script to merge two directories, resolving conflicts
    with a simple suffix
-   `git-full-clone` Script to clone a remote repository, collecting
    all the branches and effectively making a complete mirror
-   `git-update-clone` Script to keep a full-clone up-to-date with a
    remote repository. Suitable for a chron job
-   `lsync` Direct access to `rsync` with my optimized values for a
    local copy process
-   `push_it` Simple tool to initiate a `git commit` and `git push`
    to gitlab and github
-   `save_it` Simple tool to do a `git commit` forcing a GPG
    signature and using UTC


Requirements
======================================================================

All the tools are written to be used in a Linux environment, and
normally will expect to use BASH 4.3+. Each tool will have its own
requirements, which may be included in the source if they are more than
the basics of Linux + Bash.

Version Numbers
======================================================================

There is no use of version numbers within this collection. Each tool
is likely to be built, used, and forgotten, and the collection as a
whole has no "version" concept to apply.

Copyright and License
======================================================================

The MIT license applies to all the code within this repository.
